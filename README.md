# DS-503 (Advanced Data Analytics)

This is the course web-page for Advanced Data Analytics being taught at [IIT Bhilai, India](https://www.iitbhilai.ac.in/index.php) in the Monsoon Semester of 2021.
<br> Course Instructor: [Dr. Gagan Raj Gupta ](https://www.iitbhilai.ac.in/index.php?pid=gagan)

Motivation
----------

* Getting data is becoming easier day by day, but we have _too much_ to analyze (e.g. web, transactional data, text)
* Data has _errors_ of various types (missing, incorrect etc.), is _incomplete_ and is _hard to clean_ (e.g. user reviews/ratings, distorted images) 
* Data is usually _high-dimensional_ (involving lot of columns or features) (e.g. text, images, videos, graphs)
* Data usually has _complex correlations_ and i.i.d. assumptions don't always work very well (e.g. graph data, time-series data) 
* Data is being generated at a great speed and it is too expensive to store all of it (e.g. user or machine transactions, queries)
* Data (packets) on the network is encrypted 

__We are often asked to answer difficult questions from this messy data__

__We have to make decisions (often in real-time)__. 

In this course, we want to learn how that is being done and solve real-life problems that we are interested in.

Course Objectives
-----------------

* Equip students with the __mathematical toolkit__ needed for understanding and implementing the important data analysis and ML algorithms
* Explain new paradigms of __algorithm design__ for handling complex datasets including __streaming algorithms__
* Explore robust and state of the art __(SOTA)__ techniques in large scale ML
* Introduce Graph neural networks __(GNN)__ and its applications to Knowledge Graphs and Bio-informatics
* Introduce __DTW__, __Matrix Profile__ and related techniques for analyzing complex time-series data (clustering, anomaly detection, pattern mining, prediction)
* Provide hands-on experience to students in analyzing datasets in diverse fields __(NLP, Image/Video, Graphs, Networks, Bio-informatics, Finance)__


Pre-requisites
--------------
* Good knowledge of Python (most assignments will be based on Python)
* Knowledge of basic computer science principles and skills, at a level sufficient to write a reasonably non-trivial computer program 
* Math
  * Linear Algebra ( Matrix-factorization, Eigenvalues, Column and row spaces, Norms)
  * Probability theory (Conditional, Bayes Rule, Concentration Inequalities, Distributions, Gaussian, Multi-variate) 
  * Basic Data Structures, Algorithms and Asymptotic Analysis (graphs, heaps, lists, dynamic programming)
  * Calculus (Multi-variate)
  
If you don't meet one or more pre-requisites, be prepared to spend more time before or during the course in learning them.
